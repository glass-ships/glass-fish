# Glass's Custom Fish Environment

Custom fish fish environment with a (kinda) pretty prompt, and some convenience aliases and functions.

## Contents

[`setup.fish`](setup.fish): Initializes shell environment:

- Symlinks repo to `~/.config/fish`
- Copies VIM settings so it behaves how I personally like
- Checks for SSH key, creates if missing
- Sets Git user name and email (user input) if not already set

[`config.fish`](config.fish): Set some variables, configure paths, source scripts and packages, etc.

[`functions/`](functions): Contains all custom content, including:

- [`aliases`](functions/custom_aliases.fish)
- [`functions`](functions/custom_functions.fish)
- [`functions/fish_prompt.fish`](functions/fish_prompt.fish)

[`fish_variables`](fish_variables): Auto-generated by Fish. Not recommended to edit directly.

[`fish-tips/`](fish-tips): Just some useful chunks of fish code
